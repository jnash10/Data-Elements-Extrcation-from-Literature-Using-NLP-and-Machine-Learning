The folate/B6/B12 arm was added in April 1998, and the 5442 participants who were willing and eligible were randomised (at one time) using blocks of size 8 within strata defined by age and the other treatment arms. Participants were sent yearly supplies of calendar packs containing the study medications or matching placebo pills that were identical in appearance.

When a transfusion was given for symptoms of anaemia, enough red blood cells were transfused to relieve symptoms Transfusion was also permitted if haemoglobin fell < 8 g/dL.

The usual care group was not contacted again until time to schedule the six-month follow-up appointment Intervention subjects were instructed to use the scale, blood pressure cuff/heart rate monitor and the heart rhythm strip monitor at the same time each day. The transmit- ted data was then compared to individually assigned parameters based on the subject’s admission and subsequent evaluations. Readings outside these parameters were flagged for the nurse practitioner (NP) who did the monitoring. This NP, who had extensive experience in the management of heart failure patients contacted the subject to gather more information and, if appropriate, adjusted medications, usually diuretics. There were no specific protocols as to the management decisions and decisions were based on the NP’s experience and/or consultation with the subject’s cardiologist. If no flags were noted over the period of one month, the subjects were called just to maintain contact, provide encouragement and answer any questions they might have. Subjects were en- couraged to call the NP any time they wished and they were given the phone number of the direct line to the NP’s office. Reports of weight and vital sign trends were sent to participating cardiologists’ office prior to office visits. Monitoring was performed seven days a week",

Information for the AHCP was manually entered into a Microsoft Word template, printed, and spiral-bound to produce an individualised, colour booklet Implementation of the discharge plan: the DA used scripts from the training manual to review the contents of the AHCP with the participant. On the day of discharge the AHCP and discharge summary were faxed to the primary care provider (PCP) Monitoring phase: clinical pharmacist telephoned the participants 2 to 4 days after the index discharge to reinforce the discharge plan by using a scripted interview. The phar- macist had access to the AHCP and hospital discharge summary and, over several days, made at least 3 attempts to reach each participant. The pharmacist asked participants to bring their medications to the telephone to review them and address medication-related problems; the pharmacist communicated these issues to the PCP or DA Additional information on the intervention available at www.bu.edu/fammed/ projectred/index.html",

Dietary advice by dietician and study nurse; a 1.5 to 2.0 gram sodium diet was designed, minimising changes in eating patterns 2. Assessment of medication with recommendations designed to improve compliance and reduce adverse effects. A medication card was provided detailing the time and dose of all drugs. Information about side effects was given. Daily recording of weights was emphasised and patients were instructed to contact researchers for weight changes in excess of 3 to 5 pounds. Scales were provided if necessary 3. Early discharge planning: patient seen by a social worker and member of the home care team to facilitate discharge planning and ease the transition from the hospital to the home environment. Economic, social and transport problems were identified and managed 4. Enhanced follow up through home care and telephone contacts with additional assis- tance provided if needed. Patients were visited at home within 48 hours of hospital dis- charge and then 3 times in the first week and at regular intervals thereafter. At each visit, the home care nurse reinforced the teaching materials, reviewed medications, diet and activity guidelines, physical assessment, and cardiovascular examination, plus assessed for additional problem areas. Study nurse contacted patients by phone, and patients were encouraged to call researchers or personal physician with any new problems or questions Implementation of the discharge plan: yes Monitoring: yes Control intervention: all conventional treatments as requested by the patient’s attending physician.

Between 50 to 75 patients per group would be realistic to detect differences as small as 0.5 SDs in an ordinary randomized clinical trial (RCT), an effect size that is commonly regarded as a moderate change, and for which the EORTC QLQ-C30 scores are roughly comparable to a change of 10 units. This represented a plausible and realistic effect of the intervention policy. However, for a cluster randomized design, the statistical power will be reduced because of within-cluster correlation. This can be taken into account by increasing the total number of clusters, or to a lesser extent, by increasing the number of subjects per cluster. In this trial, for practical and economical reasons, participation had to be restricted to the clusters (health care districts) located within close reach from the palliative medicine unit, and it was decided to include 200 patients in each treatment group” Authors discuss issues related to recruitment attrition, and compliance in a methodolog- ical paper",

They were withdrawn from the study and underwent transmyocardial revascularization under a parallel, FDA-approved protocol for patients who could not be weaned from intravenous antianginal medications. Thus, there were three groups of patients: those randomly assigned to undergo transmyocardial revascularization and to receive continued medical therapy (132 patients), those who received medical therapy alone throughout the study (97), and those randomly assigned to receive medical therapy alone who met the criteria for treatment failure and underwent transmyocardial revascularization as part of a separate protocol (46).

It was introduced into the iliac bone between both posterior iliac spines at both sides. 500 - 600 mL of BM with a minimal number of puncture sites harvested. At least 250 mL BM must be harvested to continue with the protocol. Harvested BM was placed in a blood bag with 10,000 U of heparin sulfate and 400 microm of lysine acetylsalicylate to avoid platelet clumping. The BM was filtered on a 500 microm filter followed by a 200 microm filter. The resulting solution was mixed with hydroethylstarch 6%. The supernatant was centrifuged at 400 g for 15 mins. The cellular pellet was resuspended in PBS. The cell solution was mixed 3:1 with a solution of 155 mmol/L NH Cl, 10 mmol/ L KHCO3 and 0.1 mmol/L EDTA and set for 5 mins at room temperature. Solution was then centrifuged at 400 g for 10 mins. The pellet was washed with PBS and resuspended.

A total of 40 mL of BM blood was aspirated, and an adequate trephine biopsy was performed. BMMNC were isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. BM cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline enriched wit 10% autologous plasma to either 1 or 2 x 10 MNC/mL and returned directly to cardiac catheterisation laboratory for use. BM suspensions were tested by flow cytometry with directly conjugated antibod- ies against CD34. Intramyocardial injection. Non-fluoroscopic LV electromechanical mapping (NOGA) to identify the foci of ischaemic myocardium. During the procedure, systemic anticoagulation was achieved with intravenous heparin to maintain an activated clotting time of 250 - 300 s throughout the procedure. The targeted injection regions were selected by matching the area of ischaemic myocardium identified by SPECT. After completion of the LV electromechanical mapping, the mapping catheter was replaced by a modified mapping catheter incorporated with a 27G needle at the tip that could be used for direct endomyocardial injection. Dose of stem cells: 1.5 x 10 BMNC. Timing of stem cell procedure: Within 3 - 4 hours from cell harvest.

Discussion with regard to coping with ’slips’ and introduction to appropri- ate ways to reframe perspectives. Patients filled in daily activity sheets Session 3: focused on the importance of lifestyle balance. Patients were asked to refer to daily activity sheets to introduce concepts of shoulds and wants.

In ad- dition, patients received a mailed written persuasive communication to reinforce these points. Spouses also received telephone counselling to encourage the patient to attend and discuss methods that other patients’ spouses found useful.

It is, however, adjusted for several independent variables: state-wise hospital volume for same condition or procedure, hospital, monthly volume before publication of report card for each hospital, interaction between state volume and hospital, unrelated volume in each hospital. The method is used as follows: . based on model predict volume for hospital for each of the 12 months after publication of report card; . model volume based on data preceding publication of report card; . aggregate predicted volumes from all hospitals in same performance category; . estimate 95% confidence intervals (CI) for predictions; . if actual volume falls outside CI, then significant effect of report; 2) Autoregressive (ARIMA) methods with P = 1, q = 0 and the same main effects. As a result of software limitations, the authors were unable to include 2-way interactions. Second-order autoregressive models were also tested but generated very similar results. Because the residual autocorrelations were not significant (P > 0.10) for all but 1 model, the authors did not estimate moving average models. The autoregressive and OLS results differed, especially for AMI volume, so both sets of numbers were reported to demon- strate the sensitivity of our results to different statistical methods. Autoregressive models adjust for observed correlations, in some analyses, between current and previous volume changes; however only the OLS models adjust for hospital-level interactions",

A 4- week goal was set with the participant and reviewed each week. Within each problem area, a weekly goal and method of attainment was specified. Participant and therapist jointly assessed the degree of attainment of each goal. Goals had to be observable, de- finable and measurable and structured in a step-by-step manner. All participants com- pleted an ’intake history’ based on two interview sessions.At a third interview session they collaboratively prepared a follow-up guide that consisted of setting treatment goals and predicting 5 levels of goal attainment with an ’expected’ level of attainment by the eighth therapy session. ’Collateral persons’ (other people significant to the participant, such as spouse or probation officer) helped to identify problem areas and to validate the participant’s self report at follow-up.

Those in the intervention group then received several indi- vidually arranged meetings with a nurse care manager where they discussed problem identification, problem-specific, short-term goal setting and development of a tentative action plan. This was communicated to the primary care physician who participants were advised to contact to follow up identified problems. Then followed a collabora- tive interaction between nurse, physician, and participant focused on short-term goal attainment, plus proactive and continuous follow-up by the nurse care manager. Long- term goal setting typically occurred during subsequent nurse/participant meetings as the participant gained experience in carrying out the action plan.

Participants worked collaboratively with nurses and primary care physicians to establish individu- alised clinical and self-care goals. In structured visits at each participant’s primary care clinic every 2 to 3 weeks, nurses monitored participant’s progress in management of de- pression, control of medical disease, and self-care activities. Treatment protocols guided adjustments of commonly used medicines in participants who did not achieve specific goals. Nurses followed participants proactively to provide support for medication adher- ence. Using motivational interviewing and coaching, nurses helped participants solve problems and set goals for improved medication adherence and self care (e.g. exercising and self-monitoring blood pressure and glucose levels). Participants received self-care materials including The Depression Handbook, a video compact disk on depression care, a booklet and other materials on chronic condition management and self-monitoring de- vices (e.g. blood pressure or blood glucose meters) appropriate to their condition. Nurses received weekly supervision with a psychiatrist, primary care physician, and psychologist to review new cases and participant progress. Supervising physicians recommended ini- tial choices and changes in medications tailored to the participant’s history and clinical response. When targeted levels were reached, the nurse and the participant developed a maintenance plan that included stress reduction, behavioural goals, continued use of medications, and identification of prodromal symptoms associated with worsening de- pression and glycemic control.

Aim was to take several components and deliver them as a comprehensive package under naturalistic conditions using routine care providers to maximise real-world applicability. Two training sessions were organised for practice staff covering ways of embedding self-management tools in practice systems (session 1) and using core self-management skills in consultations and ensure participants received, or were directed to, appropriate resources (session 2). Fidelity checks and rein- forcement sessions were scheduled after training. Two facilitators delivered the training and provided access to self-management support activities and resources.

Groups were led by existing general practice teams consisting of 1 GP, 1 preventive doctor, 1 nurse practitioner and 1 patient. Sessions focused on helping participants build confidence in their ability to deal with diabetes by incorporating self-efficacy-enhancing strategies, including action-planning and feedback, modelling of behaviours by participants for one another, reinterpretation of symptoms, practicing self-management skills, and group problem-solving.

The results of the models were stratified by relevant participant and CMHC characteristics, and a 3-way interaction between the characteristic, the intervention, and time was calculated to determine whether any of these key factors moderated medication adherence. Logisitic regression models, including a random effect for site, were run to calculate the effect of the intervention on the odds of an appointment no-show. The models used data received from each CMHC on the total number of appointment no-shows and the total number of appointments (pp. 77-8).

The primary objective was to increase self efficacy in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Secondary objectives were to improve physical activity and dietary habits. Five expert patients with diabetes were recruited through advertisements. They received 3 training sessions, each lasting 31⁄2 hours. They learnt the basic principles of motivational interviewing (how to support self efficacy, coping with resistance, showing empathy, exploring discrepancies). A script was developed for use by expert patients (peer coaches) who carried out 3 monthly 1-hour home visits to discuss participant’s priorities, goals and action plans, with subsequent follow-up calls. During the first visit, areas for lifestyle change were explored. In the second visit, participants discussed the feasibility of lifestyle changes and set goals to work on over the next month. Progress towards the goals was evaluated in the third visit. Home visits lasted 1 hour on average. Within 2 weeks after each visit the expert patients contacted their participants by phone to evaluate the previous visit and answer any questions.

Arrhytmia was monitored by Holter registration. To evaluate the size of infarction 35-leads ECG, determination of CK, CKMB and myoglobins, and perfusion scintigraphy (day 12- 14 and day 27-28) were performed. There was no follow-up after the last perfusion scintigraphy at day 27-28",

There was no significant difference in myoglobin levels. 35-leads ECG showed lower STsegments on the first day of treatment with CrP compared to control. At the fifth day these differences were no longer significant Ventricular arrhythmia was another outcome of the study. CrP infusion in the early period of AMI resulted in the decreased frequency of ventricular extrasystoles in the intervention group (690 ± 179) vs the control group (2468 ± 737) (p < 0.02) during the 24 hour Holter monitoring; no significant decrease in supraventricular extrasystoles Treatment with CrP lowered likelihood of cardiac failure development.

Patients were sent printed educational material monthly. Physicians were sent guidelines on HF management and automated reports on patient progress and phoned by case managers as required The software emphasised poor adherence to medication and dietary regimens and lack of patient knowledge of signs and symptoms of clinical deterioration; and set priorities for patient education and data collection.

The cardiac rehabilitation programme consisted of three exercise sessions per week of 30-40 minutes duration for two to three months. The intervention was started after four or five exercise sessions. The intervention was based on Marlatt and Gordon’s model. Patients received individual sessions, one a week for three weeks Session 1: using pretest information, factors found to interfere with adherence were introduced. Patients discussed their perceptions on the value of exercise, listed their goals for the programme and anticipated outcomes Session 2: patients were introduced to decision-making concepts and cognitive interfer- ence factors. Discussion with regard to coping with ‘slips’ and introduction to appropri- ate ways to reframe perspectives. Patients filled in daily activity sheets Session 3: focused on the importance of lifestyle balance. Patients were asked to refer to daily activity sheets to introduce concepts of should’s and wants. Stressors were identified that may impact on lifestyle balance and discussed, as was the importance of positive thinking and use of medication. Patients also took part in a stress management exercise and relaxation procedure COMPARISON: During the course of the exercise programme patients received a ‘be- nign’ education intervention, which covered basic exercise concepts, guidelines for proper exercise participation, exercise tips and handouts, and the benefits of exercise",

In addition, patients received a mailed written persuasive communication to reinforce these points. Spouses also received telephone counselling to encourage the patient to attend and discuss methods that other patients spouses found useful. A written communication to reinforce these points was also sent to the spouse to increase the spouse’s support. Patients also received a pamphlet with information on benefits and drawbacks of exercise. All communication was tailored to individual patients based on data collected by questionnaire at baseline COMPARISON: Comparison group patients and spouses received the same pamphlet with information on the benefits and drawbacks of exercise, as the intervention group.

At that moment a protocol amendment was made after recruitment had been completed (except for the last five patients) to allow women in the observation group the option of switching to trastuzumab, irrespective of the interval since randomisation. Women who opted to switch were also given the further choice of a secondary randomisation to one year or two years of treatment with trastuzumab.

If the target blood pressure was not achieved with increasing doses, then open-label antihypertensive medications were added in a step-wise fashion, initially with metoprolol, then hydrochlorothiazide or additional drugs, but not a calcium channel blocker nor ACE inhibitor Blood pressure recordings were obtained at the time when peak drug levels were expected and were an average of 3 seated readings obtained at each visit", 
                "Notes": "Participants randomized to intensive therapy received either nisoldipine or enalapril in a blinded manner as the initial antihypertensive medication. Participants in the moderate group were given placebo. However, by the end of the study 117 participants (48%) ini- tially randomized to moderate therapy required treatment (systolic blood pressure > 159 and/or diastolic blood pressure > 89 mmHg on 2 consecutive visits). These individuals were started on either nisoldipine or enalapril according to randomization at entry into the study with the goal of maintaining the systolic blood pressure < 160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg A test for interaction between study drug assignment and blood-pressure control strategy showed that no interaction was present",

The information in this table was kindly supplied by Dr. Nancy Cook who was the statistician for the WACS and WAFACS studies (23 June 2008) The WACS study was a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial trial of 3 antioxidants, vitamins C, E and beta-carotene. Randomisation of the 8171 participants into the 8 treatment groups took place from June 1995 to October 1996, and was conducted using blocks of size 16 within 5-year age groups. The folate/B6/B12 arm was added in April 1998, and the 5442 participants who were willing and eligible were randomised (at one time) using blocks of size 8 within strata defined by age and the other treatment arms. Participants were sent yearly supplies of calendar packs containing the study medications or matching placebo pills that were identical in appearance. All medical records were reviewed by an Endpoints Committee that was blinded to treatment assignment . A priori sample size estimation: sample size with 91.5% power to detect a 20% reduction in the primary endpoint (major vascular events). For the endpoints of total CHD (defined as non-fatal MI, CHD death or revascularisation), MI and stroke, the minimum detectable risk reduction with 80% power ranges from 19% to 32%. A 2- sided significance level of 0.05 was used . Sponsor: public funding and from several industry sources. Grant HL47959 from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health. Vitamin E and its placebo were supplied by Cognis Corporation (La-Grange, Illinois) . All other agents and their placebos were supplied by BASF Corporation (Mount Olive,New Jersey). Pill packaging was provided by Cognis and BASF. They did not participate in the design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis and interpretation of the data; and preparation, review or approval of the manuscript . Other: the analyses of the endpoints were done only for these confirmed outcomes. However, there were an additional 43 recorded deaths for total mortality",
